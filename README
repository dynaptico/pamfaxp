NOTE ON PYTHON VERSIONS

    This module is for python 2.x and has only been tested against python 2.7.  

TESTS

    cd test
    python test.py

LOGGING

    This module uses the built-in Python logging, with the NullHandler added by default. You can override the default logger
    by adding the following code to your application (taken from http://docs.python.org/howto/logging.html):
    
    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger('pamfax')
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    sh = logging.StreamHandler()
    sh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    sh.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(sh)

    The documentation for this package is available at the following location:
